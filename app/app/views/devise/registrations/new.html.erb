      <p class="indent bigger-font">What it means dear user is that you are now part of a community. A community where gamers can get together with others like them, and play games in a local setting. One time you may be all held up in a small apartment with cheap pizza and discount soda, the next you may be in a 12 bedroom mansion with full catering.</p>
      <p class="indent bigger-font">As for the prices of these events? I leave that solely upto the host. I will be making tools available for hosts to give all the info needed on the party at hand. It should also be said that all financial dealings are between host and atendee. 
      <p class="indent bigger-font">Now lets talk security. Nobody is gonna wanna lug around a bunch of gear especially if there is a risk of losing it. So i will be requiring authentication of hosts prior to party launch.
